This dataset contains the posterior predictive quantiles for the Bayesian regression model using Stockton real estate data.

Contents:
1. 'result.txt' - Contains the 2.5%, 50%, and 97.5% quantiles for each of the 35 data points.
2. 'posterior_beta_summary.txt' - Contains the posterior coefficient estimates including 2.5%, 50%, and 97.5% quantiles.
3. These values were generated by running the Bayesian inference model using the 'bayesNonInformativePredictiveRun.r' script.

Methodology:
- First, run `source("bayesNonInformativeRun.r")` to generate the `posteriorSamples.txt` file and display posterior coefficient summaries automatically.
- The model uses a Bayesian non-informative prior for regression.
- Predictions were made based on new data points.
- Quantiles represent the uncertainty range of the predictions.
- The posterior coefficient summaries are printed directly and saved to `posterior_beta_summary.txt`.

For further analysis, you may modify the script to include additional statistics or visualizations.
