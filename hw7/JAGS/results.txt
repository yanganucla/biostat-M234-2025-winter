# Bayesian Behrens-Fisher Analysis - Results

## 95% Credible Intervals for Group Mean Differences (muDiff)
- Lower Bound (2.5%): -1.795017
- Median (50%): 0.1380916
- Upper Bound (97.5%): 2.103686

### Interpretation:
- Since **0 is in the credible interval**, the two group means **are significantly different**.

## 95% Credible Intervals for Variance Ratio (sigmaSqRatio)
- Lower Bound (2.5%): 0.1012248
- Median (50%): 0.2421427
- Upper Bound (97.5%): 0.5920891

### Interpretation:
- Since **1 is NOT in the credible interval**, the two variances **are significantly different**.

---

## Conclusion:
- The Bayesian Behrens-Fisher analysis suggests a **statistically significant difference in variances** not significant in  means between the two groups. The result of mean is a little different with method without use loop.
