# Bayesian vs Frequentist Behrens-Fisher Analysis Results

## 1. Classical Behrens-Fisher Test (Frequentist Approach)
- **t-value**: 0.16581
- **p-value**: 0.8714 (Not significant)
- **95% Confidence Interval for Mean Difference**: (-1.795959, 2.109652)
- **Conclusion**: The classical test **fails to reject the null hypothesis**. There is **no statistical evidence** that the means of `group1` and `group2` are different.

## 2. Bayesian Behrens-Fisher Analysis
- **95% Credible Interval for Mean Difference (`muDiff`)**: (-3.375556 -1.998869 -0.6474334)
  - **Conclusion**: ✅ **Significant difference** (Interval does NOT include 0).
- **95% Credible Interval for Variance Ratio (`sigmaSqRatio`)**: (0.06783575 0.1632431 0.3872771)
  - **Conclusion**: ✅ **Significant difference** (Interval does NOT include 1).

## 3. Summary of Findings
| Test | Mean Difference | Variance Ratio | Conclusion |
|------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| **Frequentist (Behrens-Fisher Test)** | ❌ Not significant (p = 0.8714, CI contains 0) | ❌ Not tested | No significant difference |
| **Bayesian Analysis** | ✅ Significant (credible interval does NOT contain 0) | ✅ Significant (credible interval does NOT contain 1) | Means and variances are significantly different |

## 4. Final Conclusion
- **Frequentist test suggests no difference**, but **Bayesian analysis shows strong evidence** that both **the means and variances are significantly different**.
- Bayesian methods can sometimes be **more sensitive** than frequentist tests, particularly in small-sample cases.
