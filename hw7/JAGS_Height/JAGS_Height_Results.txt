# Bayesian Behrens-Fisher Analysis - Height Data

## 95% Credible Intervals for Group Mean Differences (muDiff)
- Lower Bound (2.5%): -3.2312
- Median (50%): -1.8181
- Upper Bound (97.5%): -0.3592

### Interpretation:
- Since **0 is NOT in the credible interval**, the two group means **are significantly different**.

---

## 95% Credible Intervals for Variance Ratio (sigmaSqRatio)
- Lower Bound (2.5%): 0.7537
- Median (50%): 1.5762
- Upper Bound (97.5%): 3.3009

### Interpretation:
- Since **1 IS in the credible interval**, the two variances **are NOT significantly different**.

---

## Conclusion:
- The Bayesian Behrens-Fisher analysis suggests a **statistically significant difference in means** between the two height groups (US vs. Swedish).
- However, **variance differences are NOT statistically significant**.
