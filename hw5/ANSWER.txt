Residual standard error: 0.1513 on 1360 degrees of freedom
Multiple R-squared:  0.8111,	Adjusted R-squared:   0.81 
F-statistic: 729.9 on 8 and 1360 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16

OLS estimates (from `lm(Y ~ ., data = data)`) show similar trends, with the following key values:
  - Adjusted R-squared: 0.81
  - Residual standard error: 0.1513

### Interpretation of Results:
1. **Significance of Coefficients**:
   - If the **95% credible interval (CI)** of a coefficient does not include zero, it suggests strong evidence that the variable significantly influences the dependent variable.
   - **X1, X5, and X6 have positive credible intervals**, meaning they have a strong positive effect on Y.
   - **X2, X3, and X4 have negative credible intervals**, indicating a strong negative relationship with Y.

2. **Practical Implications**:
   - **X1 (0.0588 to 0.0632)** → Since the entire CI is positive, X1 has a strong positive effect.
   - **X2 (-0.00236 to -0.00127)** → Entirely negative, suggesting a weak but statistically significant negative effect.
   - **X3 and X4** → Both have strictly negative intervals, confirming their negative impact.
   - **X5 (0.0108 to 0.0473)** → A positive and significant impact, but the range suggests some variability.
   - **X6 (2.8596 to 6.4793)** → Strongest positive influence with a large effect size.

3. **Bayesian vs. OLS Estimates**:
   - Bayesian estimates are similar to OLS results but provide a full probability distribution of parameters.
   - The Bayesian approach allows uncertainty quantification, making it more informative than point estimates alone.

4. **Residual Variance**:
   - The posterior distribution of residual variance is **strictly negative**, which may indicate a need for transformation or re-examination of the prior distribution.

Overall, the Bayesian model confirms the OLS findings while providing additional insights into parameter uncertainty and significance.
